Algorithms for array query problem:
1) Lookup table technique
    -> The memory required is more as it uses 2-D array representation. i.e O(n*n)
    -> The time complexity is O(n*n)
    -> Query time is faster i.e O(1)

2) Square root decomposition:
    -> If 'n' is the size of the array, it divides the array into sqrt(n) blocks and makes the searching faster than the 2-d lookup table.
    -> The space required is n as it uses 1-d array.
   
3) Segment Tree: 
    -> This technique is used when there are more number of queries and the array elements are not changing.
    -> Each node in a tree represents a interval or segment.
    -> Once the tree is built it's structure cannot be modified,if any one value changes the tree is rebuilt.
    -> It is built using recursion, bottom-up approach.
 
4) Kadane's Algorithm:
    -> It is a dynamic programming algorithm used to print the sub array with maximum sum
